    "\n",
    "- **Multiplication**: Multiplying two numbers. For example: `5 * 6` equals `30`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Division**: Dividing one number by another. For example: `10 / 2` equals `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exponentiation**: Raising a number to a power. For example: `2 ** 3` equals `8`, which means 2 raised to the power of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modulo**: Finding the remainder of a division. For example: `9 % 4` equals `1`, as 9 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic expressions can also include parentheses to control the order of operations. For example: `(2 + 3) * 4` equals `20`. In this case, the addition inside the parentheses is performed first, and then the result is multiplied by 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples showcase some of the basic arithmetic operations you can perform in mathematical computations and programming. By combining these operators and values, you can create complex expressions to solve various mathematical problems and perform calculations in data analysis, scientific computing, and more.\n"
